About
David Warner commenced his IPL journey at the Delhi franchise in 2009 and after 13 years, with a bag full of experience, loads of runs under his belt and having won the IPL title with Sunrisers Hyderabad, he returns to represent the team in 2022. Warner, who is the fifth-highest run getter in the history of the IPL with 5449 runs to his name, is one of the most destructive openers across formats and he will be keen to make a mark right from the word go for DC.
